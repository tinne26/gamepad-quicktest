# gamepad-quicktest

Very basic program to test a gamepad with [Ebitengine](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) (v2.5.0 or higher required):
```
go run github.com/tinne26/gamepad-quicktest@latest
```

Interactive web version also available at [tinne26.github.io/gamepad-quicktest](https://tinne26.github.io/gamepad-quicktest/).

(Notice that the official example on [ebiten/examples/gamepad](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/tree/main/examples/gamepad) is more complete and you can also test it [interactively](https://ebitengine.org/en/examples/gamepad.html), though web behavior can vary from desktop, as the APIs used under the hood are not the same ones)
